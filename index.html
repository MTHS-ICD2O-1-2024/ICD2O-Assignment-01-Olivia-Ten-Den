        <q
          >As you will see, you are called to be a minister while in the
          workforce and living in the marketplace.</q
        ><br /><br />
        <q>Satan doesn’t need to deceive us; he just needs to keep us busy.</q
        ><br /><br />
        <q
          >We can’t view our work as a compartment where the work personality
          shows up. No, as stated at the beginning of this chapter, we each need
          to strive to be an integrated person where the personality that shows
          up at faith, family, work, and play is in fact one in the same.</q
